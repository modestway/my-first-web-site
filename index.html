  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
  Since WorldWideWeb was developed on and for the NeXTSTEP platform, the program uses many of NeXTSTEP's components â€“ WorldWideWeb's layout engine was built around NeXTSTEP's Text class.
  [1]WorldWideWeb is capable of displaying basic style sheets,[4] downloading and opening any file type with a MIME type that is also supported by the NeXT system (PostScript,[2][4] movies, and sounds[4]), browsing newsgroups, and spellchecking. In earlier versions, images are displayed in separate windows, until NeXTSTEP's Text class gained support for Image objects.[4] WorldWideWeb is able to use different protocols: FTP, HTTP, NNTP, and local files. Later versions are able to display inline images.
